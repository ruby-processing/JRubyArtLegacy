### Any editor
From console:-

```bash
mkdir 'any_name'
cd 'any_name'
touch 'fred.rb'
```

### Vim

Open new console
```bash
cd 'any_name'
vim fred.rb
```
In 1st console
```bash
k9 -w fred.rb
# A bare sketch is displayed with a default size, background etc.
```
Edit sketch in vim eg
```ruby
background 0
# Sketch reloads on `:w` save with a black background
# PS: in processing this is a so called static sketch (ie no draw loop)
# no interaction is possible via mouse etc
```

### Other editors eg atom

From console
```
atom fred.rb
# opens sketch for editing in atom
```
From same console
```bash
k9 -w fred.rb
# As above a bare sketch is displayed with default background
```
Edit sketch in atom, on save sketch will reload

### Normal sketches (ie with draw loop, sketch_title etc)
Use the JRubyArt sketch creator facility to create an outline sketch as follows

```bash
k9 -c fred 200 200
# creates fred.rb, with `size 200, 200` you can do interesting
# things with code in the draw loop
```
Then `watch`, and `edit` as above (with editor of choice, preferably vim for console, or atom for gui, with `language-jruby-art package`).

Suggested exercises:-
1. set background and fill in the draw loop, draw ellipse (or rect) in fixed location, then substitute `mouse_x` or `mouse_y` for `x` or `y` coordinates...
2. Experiment with no background, semi transparent background, or semi transparent fill eg `background(color(200, 0, 0, 50))` or `fill(200, 100)`
