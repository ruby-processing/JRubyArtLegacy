# JRubyArt
Depends on jruby, and processing, without them this project would not exist. I see this as being a development of ruby-processing and many others were involved in developing that see [github][] for a complete list of contributors. This is fresh start so for ruby-processing history see [github] logs.

## JRuby

The whole @jruby team, including @headius and @enebo

## Processing

The whole @ProcessingOrg team, especially @benfry, @REAS, and @codeanticode

## Ruby-processing

Ruby-processing was started by @jashkenas, but there were many other contributors including @moumar, @fjennet.
